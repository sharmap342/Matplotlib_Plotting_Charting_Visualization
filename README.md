# Matplotlib_Plotting_Charting_Visualization

## This repository contains steps for making different types of charts, plots, graphs, and visualization in matplotlib.     

The first two notebooks describe different aspects of reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. Different components of good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations are discussed. It aslo describe best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework of matplotlib. Different functionalties available in matplotlib, and a variety of basic statistical charts to identify when a particular method is good for a particular problem are discussed.  

The third notebook solves a real world problem to apply the concepts learned in first notebooks. Here the effect of weather condition on the spread of coronavirus is visualized using the matplotlib library. Different weather parameters - temperature, humidity were plotted agains the confirmed Covid-19 cases to understand the effect of temperature on the spread of Covid-19.
